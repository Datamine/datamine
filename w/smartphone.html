 Smartphone Ownership Review
</atitle>

<p>
I held out on smartphones until February 2014. Up until then, I used a regular old dumbphone that I bought at a Walgreens some years back. My primary reason for not wanting a smartphone were mostly that I wasn&rsquo;t sure whether or not having a smartphone was actually <i>good for you</i>. My friends gave their smartphones ringing endorsements: &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do without it,&rdquo;  &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t leave my house without my phone,&rdquo;  etc. The flip-side of these endorsements was that they signaled <i>dependency</i>. It seemed to me that the smartphone created its own necessity and then fostered a relationship in which the user would be dependent on the gadget. That seemed unhealthy to me.
</p>
<p>
I was also intimidated by how smartphones seemed to persistently occupy their users. The endless flurry of notifications is well-known, and it is common to see people in social situations silently staring at their phones in unison. This has been amply discussed and made fun of, but I was actually more concerned with how smartphones <i>eliminate boredom</i>. Smartphones enable the user to be constantly connected to a practically-endless repository of entertainment. If the user chooses to, they may use their phone so as to be fully engaged with media, perpetually  entertained, mentally busy, without a moment of pause, ever. I find this concerning, as I believe quite strongly that small periods of &lsquo;boredom&rsquo; &mdash; time to actually be alone with one&rsquo;s thoughts and to <i>think</i> &mdash; can be creatively very productive. I was afraid of losing those precious moments throughout the day, the few minutes between tasks during which I can just day-dream.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, not owning a smartphone came at a considerable price. As a software developer, it effectively excluded me from what is probably the second-most important technological platform, after the internet<small><sup><a href="#footnote0" name="note0">[0]</a></sup></small>. On top of that, I obviously wasn&rsquo;t getting any of the consumer-end benefits of owning a smartphone &mdash; concretely, the technological convenience in being constantly connected to the rest of the world. The feeling that the merits of owning a smartphone might outweigh the demerits mounted and gradually nagged me into getting one.
</p>
<p>
Owning a smartphone has been enormously useful. There are great and obvious benefits to essentially having internet access everywhere I go and carrying an ecosystem of useful services (apps) in my pocket. It has, in short, saved me a great deal of time and money, and has been very helpful in avoiding stressful situations.
</p>
<p>
However, my fear that owning a smartphone would persistently eliminate boredom and essentially usurp my day-dreaming time has largely become reality. Whenever I find myself with a few seconds to spare, I check my phone &mdash; I most often look at Twitter, Hacker News, and Google Finance. The underlying trouble here seems to be that smartphones integrate extremely well with following <i>the news</i>, and that the news are, more or less, a form of mental junk-food. Virtually everything I read on my phone I forget within minutes. It&rsquo;s usually so irrelevant to my life that it is completely ephemeral, but it <i>feels</i> very engaging and stimulating and good while I&rsquo;m reading it. Following the news is, with some exception, an unproductive past-time, but it&rsquo;s quite addictive.
</p>
<p>
Thus, as feared, I find myself wasting quite a lot of time on my phone. To make things worse, the way in which I am wasting this time is subtly stressful. Smartphones enable constant access to a practically-endless repository of very seductive media. Managing this (and occasionally interacting with this body of media) without letting it consume significant amounts of one&rsquo;s time and energy is a serious challenge. I think my smartphone has been enormously useful, but I&rsquo;m also quite aware and concerned that it has replaced those very restorative, highly creatively generative little morsels of time that I used to have to myself with stressful bursts of news-checking.
</p>
<p>
To conclude: I am rather happy with my smartphone as a useful consumer device. I&rsquo;m less happy with the relationship I have to my phone. My phone has more control over how I spend my time than I would like it to have. I don&rsquo;t view this as an issue intrinsic to smartphones, but simply as a challenge for me to manage.

 Notes on News
</sh>

</p>
<p>
I made several claims about the stressfulness of following the news. I follow news in technology and finance extremely closely due to necessity, and more or less disregard the rest. My reason for this is mostly that I have finite amounts of time and mental energy to expend every day, and I need to allocate those as effectively as possible. Beyond that, I&rsquo;m not so convinced of the utility of (reading) vast sections of the news. My position can be explained reasonably well by the following articles:
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hatethenews">Aaron Swartz: <i>I hate the news</i></a></li>
<li> <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/12/news-is-bad-rolf-dobelli">The Guardian: <i>News is bad for you &mdash; and giving up reading it will make you happier</i></a></li>
</ul>
I should note that I think of &ldquo;news&rdquo;  as a class of media broader than traditional journalism: I consider e.g. tweets, status updates, and most forms of media notifications as news.
