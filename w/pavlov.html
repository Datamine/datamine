Pavlovian Triggers for Productivity
</atitle>
<br><br>

<p>
In 1901, the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov ran a set of experiments on dogs. He would ring a bell, and then present the dogs with food.
After establishing this pattern, he rang the bell, and then did not present the dogs with food, but found that they nonetheless salivated
as if they were about to eat. Pavlov concluded that when there exists a pair of physical stimulus and response (e.g. food as stimulus
and salivation as response), it is possible to teach an association between the physical stimulus and an unrelated stimulus (e.g. a ringing bell),
such that even when the physical stimulus is removed, the unrelated stimulus still provokes the physical response. This is called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning">classical conditioning</a> and it is one of the staples of modern
psychology.
</p>

<p>
lots of productivity hacks are implicitly using classical conditioning, e.g.:
- sleep mask to bring on sleep faster
- spaces like study rooms and offices that have strong work associations

the hardest thing about work is usually getting started, which conditioning enables quite easily
there's some funny stuff about the "pavlok":

- http://beyondgrowth.net/social-criticism/the-pavlok-a-shockingly-bad-idea/
which seems to no longer be operating. (amazon isn't selling their product anymore, reviews have died down.)
