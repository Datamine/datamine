 Everything I Write is Wrong and that&rsquo;s All Right
</atitle>
<br><br>
<p>
Looking back on my public blog posts so far, I've published something about once every three months.
Frankly, that&rsquo;s not as often as I would like to publish,
especially considering that my <i>list of things to write about</i> grows by about one bullet point every day.
Writing is among my oldest hobbies, and I&rsquo;ve always
loved writing for myself or for school.
So: why do I struggle with the relatively straightforward task of keeping a blog?
</p>
<p>
For a start, I know that anything I put on the internet is going to be there for a long time.
No matter when I &ldquo;take down&rdquo;  a piece of content,
it&rsquo;ll be archived somewhere: perhaps difficult to access, but existent all the same,
and totally beyond my control. Being a little bit
self-conscious, the notion that <i>there is no undo button on the internet</i> is intimidating,
especially because most things worth writing about are inherently controversial.
</p>
<p>
So, feeling the same chilling effects as everyone else, I usually steer clear of writing about
particularly controversial topics.
But most of the topics on my <i>list of things to write about</i> are ideologically quite neutral.
Why don&rsquo;t I write about those? For neutral topics, I&rsquo;m certainly not afraid of being
judged for my opinions. Rather, the issue is
that there never seems to be a good time to publish: any moment is too soon.
</p>
<p>
When I write about something, I take a snapshot of the state of my thoughts on the topic:
I capture what I currently believe and question.
However, the problem is that any snapshot is almost immediately outdated.
Opinions, beliefs, and even some facts perpetually evolve.
As such, I know that my beliefs and
stances on issues are ephemeral: nuance is added, counter-arguments
are found, and occasionally, changes in
fundamental assumptions demand carefully re-thinking everything.
</p>
<p>
When I read what I wrote when I was seventeen, I find a great deal of material that
is in some way lacking. Sometimes I
missed obvious counter-arguments, at other times I
made assumptions that were plainly naive. Some of the things I wrote
were just factually wrong. Some of my work was decent, but
it was mostly immature work: I appreciate the material as steps
that were necessary for me to become a better writer/thinker, and
I may even feel nostalgic about it, but all-in-all, it&rsquo;s
a little embarrassing and I&rsquo;d prefer not to share it with others.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, I am confident that a few years from now, I will
look back on my best work of today as lacking in many respects.<small><sup><a href="#footnote3" name="note3">[0]</a></sup></small>
This situation is not unique to me.
Even the greatest artists
were often among the harshest critics of their past work.
Orson Welles expressed genuine shame when called
Citizen Kane&rsquo;s Rosebud motif a
&rdquo;tawdry plot device&rdquo; some nineteen years
after the fact.<small><sup><a href="#footnote0" name="note0">[1]</a></sup></small>
</p>
<p>
Taking this theme to its logical conclusion: the real
trouble is that <i>all work is immature work</i>.
The best day to publish an opinion is always tomorrow,
when you&rsquo;re just a little bit wiser
and your material is just a little bit better.
So, how does anyone ever publish?
</p>
<p>
There are many good reasons to write and publish even decidedly flawed work, but I want to argue
one particular point: that time is of the essence. There is great pressure to publish sooner rather than later. The greater context of your work is
always subject to change, which can swiftly render your project irrelevant before you even publish it. Especially when
writing about current events, it&rsquo;s important to publish while you have <i>something</i>.<small><sup><a href="#footnote1" name="note1">[2]</a></sup></small>
Let me tell you about a mistake I made:
</p>
<p>
In the latter half of 2015, it became apparent to me that Trump was most likely going to capture the Republican nomination
and have a good shot at winning the presidential election, due to some factors that were hitherto unseen in US politics.
I thought I had a few salient, original observations, but I held off on writing because Trump&rsquo;s campaign (and the
general political landscape) was shifting too quickly: I thought that if I held out a little longer and did more research,
I could understand this enigma even better. I waited too long. Other writers made my points while I waited, and the political
situation has changed such that at this stage, these observations are no longer useful anyway.
</p>
<p>
<li>
  In general, people are remembered for their best work.
  The embarrassment over a bad piece of work is usually minimal. DFW is still popular despite his immensely shitty piece on AIDS.
  However, the consensus on what is good work often doesn&rsquo;t converge until much later, sometimes with surprising results.
  Keats&rsquo; poems were universally panned during his lifetime. Monet and Kafka attempted to destroy substantial portions of their own work, mostly due to concerns over quality.
  I think it would be a reasonable approach not to worry about the quality of an individual piece of work, but rather to treat creating good work as a low-probability event, and
  as with all low-probability events, the best strategy for hitting that event is simply to try, i.e. publish, a great number of times.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Thus, I&rsquo;ve made peace with my perfectionist concerns about writing. I recognize that others will always be able to find shortcomings in what I write.
I understand that to write publicly about anything means to accept up-front that I may, in the future, regard my work as incomplete, perhaps mildly embarrassing,
at worst straight-up bad. But that&rsquo;s okay. It&rsquo;s a worthwhile price to pay for the only way to move forward.
</p>

the permanence of the internet / attaching my name to something amplify the intimidation factor of being wrong
<hr>

<p>
<a href="#note3" name="footnote3">[0]</a> This has had some benefits.
Reflecting on most of my past work and calling it wrong or limited, there is an
easy logical extension to make: when I argue a point nowadays, I expect that
I am probably, in some sense, wrong. This has made me more humble in discussion.
When debating, I now usually work on the assumption that there are essential facts that
at least I am missing. I have become more careful to try to genuinely understand
the opposing view. This has been a very productive change in attitude.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#note0" name="footnote0">[1]</a> Orson Welles: <a href="https://amzn.com/B00374G3NO">The Paris Interview</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#note1" name="footnote1">[2]</a> Another way to think about this is that once your work gets past a certain quality threshold (your work only has to be worth your readers&rsquo; time), the
cost of <i>not publishing</i> is greater than the cost of publishing, and it becomes worth it to publish, even if your work isn&rsquo;t anywhere near as good as it could be.
Similarly, for writing on current events or topics where public opinion is rapidly evolving,
it seems plausible that there exists a point at which the marginal returns in quality on further time investment are not only diminishing, but achieving these returns
constitutes a <i>net loss</i> because the cost of waiting is much larger: as time passes, the greater societal context is shifting,
which threatens to render your work less relevant upon publication. Compromises with imperfection seem almost always necessary.
</p>
<p>
The greatest
tragedy of all is to spend a great deal of time crafting a perfect piece, only for it to be hopelessly obsolete upon publication &mdash; never to be read &mdash;
because the debate it addresses has moved well past that matter. It is an important and unpleasant reality that
most people simply are not willing to rewind a debate to some
point far in the past, no matter how good the reason.
To persuade a majority of participants and build the consensus required to actually rewind a debate seems well-nigh impossible.
