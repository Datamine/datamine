 Everything I Write is Wrong and that&rsquo;s All Right
</atitle>
<br><br>
<p>
Looking back on my public blog posts so far, I've published something about once every three months. Frankly, that&rsquo;s not as often as I would like to publish,
especially considering that my <i>list of things to write about</i> grows by about one bullet point every day. Writing is among my oldest hobbies, and I&rsquo;ve always
loved writing for myself or for school. So why do I struggle with the relatively straightforward task of keeping a blog?
</p>
<p>
For a start, I know that anything I put on the internet is going to be there for a long time. No matter when I &ldquo;take down&rdquo;  a piece of content,
it&rsquo;ll be archived somewhere: perhaps difficult to access, but existent all the same, and totally beyond my control. Being a little bit
self-conscious, the notion that <i>there is no undo button on the internet</i> is intimidating, especially because most things worth writing about are inherently controversial.
</p>
<p>
So, feeling the same chilling effects as everyone else, I usually steer clear of writing about particularly controversial topics.
But most of the topics on my <i>list of things to write about</i> are ideologically quite neutral.
</p>
<p>
Why don&rsquo;t I write about those? I&rsquo;m certainly not afraid of being judged for my opinions in this domain. Rather, the issue is
that there never seems to be a good time to publish: any moment is too soon.
</p>
<p>
When I write about something, I capture what I currently know, believe, and question. An essay  represents a snapshot of the
current state of my thoughts on a topic: the problem with this is that any snapshot is almost immediately outdated.
Opinions, beliefs, and occasionally even facts, are never fixed; they evolve. Similarly, I know that my beliefs and
stances on issues are ephemeral: nuance is added, counter-arguments are found, and occasionally, changes in the
larger context demand carefully re-thinking everything.
</p>
<p>
When I read what I wrote when I was seventeen, I find a great deal of material that is in some way lacking. Sometimes I
missed obvious counter-arguments, at other times I made assumptions that were plainly naive. Some of the things I wrote
were just factually wrong. Some of it was decent, but by and large it is immature work: I appreciate the material as steps
that were necessary for me to become a better writer/thinker, and I may even feel nostalgic about it, but all-in-all, it&rsquo;s
still a little embarrassing and I&rsquo;d prefer not to share it with others.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, I am confident that a few years from now, I will look back on my best work of today as lacking in many respects.
This situation is not unique to me. Even the greatest artists were often among the harshest critics of their past work.
Orson Welles expressed genuine shame when called Citizen Kane&rsquo;s Rosebud motif a
&rdquo;tawdry plot device&rdquo; some nineteen years after the fact.<small><sup><a href="#footnote1" name="note1">[0]</a></sup></small>
</p>
<p>
Taking this theme to its logical conclusion: the real trouble is that <i>all work is immature work</i>.
The best day to publish an opinion is always tomorrow, when you&rsquo;re just a little bit wiser
and your material is just a little bit better. So, how does anyone ever publish?
</p>
<p>
I hardly ever publish anything, so I am scarcely qualified to answer this question. However, it seems that there are a few motivating truths we can rely on:
<ul>
<li> Writing, in the first place, is worthwhile. It&rsquo;s a great tool for structuring and exploring your thoughts.
Developing rigorous arguments on paper tightens your theses and exposes weaknesses in a way that idle musing doesn&rsquo;t.
Beyond that, actually writing down your thoughts is very helpful for when you try to pick up the thread later down the line.</li>
<br>
<li> Flawed work is a necessary step on a journey to better work. Sharing the products of those steps can be helpful to others who are at similar stages.</li>
<br>
<li> Even though a piece of work may become eventually obsolete, it is well possible for that work to be very valuable
before then (and sometimes even after) [permanently merit its existece...]. Plato and Freud are good examples: their work was once the state of the art,
but now we regard it as mostly wrong. Nonetheless, it remains totally worthwhile reading.
Your work doesn&rsquo;t have to be the greatest ever; it only has to be worth the reader&rsquo;s time.
</li>
[...there's another note to be made somewhere about how even this essay isn't v good. style is totally lacking. but i don't have the time to work on it forever; so i must compromise
w imperfection.]
<br>
<li> Timeliness is everything: there is pressure to publish sooner rather than later. The greater context of your work is
always subject to change, which can swiftly render your project irrelevant before you even publish it. Especially when
writing about current events, it&rsquo;s important to publish while you have <i>something</i>. Let me tell you about a mistake I made:
</p>
<p>
In the latter half of 2015, it became apparent to me that Trump was most likely going to capture the Republican nomination and have a good shot at winning the presidential election. He was campaigning in a way that was hitherto unseen in the US. I thought I had a few salient, original observations, but I held off on writing because Trump&rsquo;s campaign (and the general political landscape) was shifting too quickly: I thought that if I held out a little longer and did more research, I could understand this enigma even better. I waited too long. Other writers made my points while I waited, and the political situation has changed such that at this stage, these observations are no longer useful anyway.
</p>
<p>
<li> In general, people are remembered for their best work. However, the consensus on what is good work often doesn&rsquo;t converge until much later, sometimes with surprising results.
  Keats&rsquo; poems were universally panned during his lifetime. Monet and Kafka attempted to destroy substantial portions of their own work, mostly due to concerns over quality.
  I think it would be a reasonable approach not to worry about the quality of an individual piece of work, but rather to treat creating good work as a low-probability event, and
  as with all low-probability events, the best strategy for hitting that event is simply to try, i.e. publish, a great number of times.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Thus, I&rsquo;ve made peace with my perfectionist concerns about writing. I recognize that others will always be able to find shortcomings in what I write.
I understand that to write publicly about anything means to accept up-front that I may, in the future, regard my work as incomplete, perhaps mildly embarrassing,
at worst straight-up bad. But that&rsquo;s okay. It&rsquo;s a worthwhile price to pay for the only way to move forward. Here&rsquo;s to publishing more in the future!
