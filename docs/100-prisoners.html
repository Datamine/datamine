    Abstract
</atitle>
<br><br>
<p>
    I present the <i>100 prisoners problem</i>, a counter-intuitive result in mathematics.
    Specifically, [something about randomness]
</p>
<br>
<atitle>
    The 100 Prisoners Problem
</atitle>
<br><br>
<p>
    Somewhere far away, there exists a prison containing 100 prisoners.
    The warden is about to put them all to death, but decides to give them one
    last chance &mdash; if they can solve his challenge, they get to
    live.<small><sup><a href="#footnote0" name="note0">[0]</a></sup></small>
    The challenge is as follows:
</p>
<p class='blockquote'>
    The prisoners are numbered 1 through 100.
    Every prisoner, one after another, is led into a room, where there are 100 drawers. The drawers
    are also numbered 1 through 100. The warden has randomly put one prisoner's
    number into each drawer. Each prisoner gets to open exactly 50 drawers.
    If the prisoner finds their number, they pass. If any prisoner fails,
    all the prisoners are put to death. The room is swept and reset after each prisoner,
    so there is no way for them to communicate. However, they get to strategize before
    they all start. What is the best strategy for the prisoners?
</p>
<p>
    At first, it seems hopeless. For any given prisoner, if they randomly open 50 out of 100 drawers,
    the chance they'll find their number is $\tfrac{50}{100} = \tfrac{1}{2}$.
    And the prisoners can't communicate, so the probability is <i>independently</i> $\tfrac{1}{2}$ for
    every prisoner. When we want to find the probability of multiple independent events
    occurring, we have to multiply their individual probabilities: the chance that
    all 100 prisoners find their numbers is $\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\right)^{100}$. This is
    an exceedingly small number: if, since the <i>beginning of time</i>,
    you tried this a <i>billion times a second</i>, your chance of succeeding <i>just once</i>
    would be about $\tfrac{1}{100,000}$.
</p>
<p>
    So that's not very good. How do the prisoners get a better chance?
</p>
<p>
    I had to answer some questions.

    <a href="#note0" name="footnote0">[0]</a> The reader might &mdash; and should &mdash; find this hypothetical
        prison's capricious
        and careless treatment of justice and human life most disagreeable.
